## How's the repository organized?
- Labs contains all the code that was done every week on the laboratory. Inside every paste, you will found a PDF explaining the exercise, and the actual code. You will need to compile the code yourself to see it running, or put it online, on [onlinegdb](https://www.onlinegdb.com) for example.
- On tp1, tp2 & tp3, there is what we call Practical Work (TP for short in Portuguese), basically bigger exercises that require more time and thinking. The PDF containing the explaining is also there, it's missing for tp2, sorry. The tp3 is incomplete, and i have no plannings to finish it.
- Don't forget to read the license before doing something !
